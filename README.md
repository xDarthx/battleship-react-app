# Jacob's Battleships!

This is a project from the Odin Project. My professor also required that we have an AI chatbot create one of the main functions. We were not allowed to change any of it; only the AI chatbot could.
So, I had the AI chatbot Claude create the gameboard function and do the styles.

Main languages are React, HTML, and CSS
